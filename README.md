## My process

I divided the page into sections to start, then added HTML to each section, and finally applied styles to each section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I gained knowledge about utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive website.


### Continued development

I want to get better at styling without utilizing CSS frameworks.
